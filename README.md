# Maven-Market-Analysis
This is an analysis of Maven market sales between the year 1997 to 1998 
This project is based on Market sales of Maven. The dateset was acquired from Maven Analysis. PowerBi was used for the entire project.
The first step was data loading, cleaning and transformation, in order to make the data readable and easy for analysis. All this where done with help of power query editor.
After the data transformation, our work was loaded onto PowerBi desktop. Then relationship model was done where primary and foreign keys were used. The relationship is one to many relationship and the model formed was Snowflakes Schema. The third step was DAX operations to create measures, in order to gain better insight about the data.
Afterwards, visual dashboard was created with the use of different visualization tools (column chart, gauge chart, treemap, map, matrix, slicer and card) to show more insights about the market sales.
Finally, the project was published on PowerBi cloud for public view and criticism.

All thanks to DataKliq team, they open my eye to data analysis with data analysis course.
